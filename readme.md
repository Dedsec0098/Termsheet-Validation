This project aims to simply the process of matching termsheets that are recieved in huge volumes by the comercial banks. These banks records million of transactions each day and they also need to sign multiple termsheets from an individual to big organisations. Hence to reduce redudancy and make a error prone solution of checking each termsheet individually, we made a product which will enhance the efficiency of the bank and make it easier to match termsheets and validate it.
